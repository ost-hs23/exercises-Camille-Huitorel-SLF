# The 3 sections

## A task that gave me joy

-   Organize my main ideas from references or topics in a tool like Obsidian and see the links between them (which is really useful for writing)

-   

## A task that was challenging

-   Be confident to write in a proper scientific language, in English. But now I use either a LLMs or Grammatical to help me.

## What I want to learn

-   Discover new tools to share my project and be more efficient in my scientific writing.
