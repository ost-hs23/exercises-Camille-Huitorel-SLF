1.  Create a 2 row x 2 column table, populate with a column for restaurant + column for cuisine. Then, cross reference it from text.
| Restaurant | Cuisine    |
|------------|------------|
| 5 Chickens | 12 Chickens|


: Chicken {#tbl-chicken}

See @tbl-chicken.

2.  Include the Quarto logo from the `images/` folder as a figure. Add a caption, id, and cross-reference to the figure.

![Quarto logo](images/quarto-logo.png){#fig-quarto}

This is illustrated well by @fig-quarto.

3.  **Stretch goal:** Add a caption, label, and cross-reference to the figure generated from the code below.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| label: bill-dims-species
#| fig-cap: "Plot"

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species,
                     shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()

```
