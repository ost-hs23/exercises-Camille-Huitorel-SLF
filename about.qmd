PhD student at the avalanche research center WSL-SLF Davos and the University ETH Zurich, I'm working with a numerical coupling method named CFD-DEM ('Continuum Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method") to decipher the influence of saturation degree and of pore pressure within bed sediment on the entrainment rate and flow mobility of Alpine Mass Movements.

Recently graduated with two masters in geophysics, with a specialty in telluric natural risks from 'Institut Physique du Globe de Paris' in Paris, I have also a good background in the processing of seismic, geospatial or electrical, magnetic acquisition data, and so on.\
\
I am also able to develop advanced tools in Python: for visualization, data processing, for the development of models and simulation tools, for detection and classification thanks to the integration of machine learning models.
